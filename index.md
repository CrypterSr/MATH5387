## Course Overview

Regression analysis is the most popular modeling tool in all of statistics.  In this course you will learn how to fit a regression model to data and then make statistical inference about the model.  The statistical inference is based on various assumptions, so we will learn how to assess model fit and determine whether the appropriate assumptions are met.  Often, more than one model will appear to fit the data reasonably well, so we will also learn various approaches to selecting a good model.  The course will involve using R statistical software to do much of the analysis.  Some proofs will be required for the course, and examples of the expected types of proofs will be supplied during the course.
